# AutoJoomer
AutoJoomer will help you join classes on time (IIIT Kottayam 2020). Works for all classes, including labs; and also coding classes; fetches data from hosted database which can be changed whenever there are changes in the timetable.

## Installation
1. Download all the files to a folder either by the "Download as ZIP" button or by cloning the repo.
2. Open your browser, navigate to "Extensions" panel -> "Manage Extensions".
3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top-right.
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where you downloaded/cloned the files.
5. Navigate to "Extensions" panel -> click on "AutoJoomer".
6. Set the required values, click "SAVE", and restart your browser / reload the extension.

## How to stay updated
To stay up-to-date with the latest version hosted on github, while being in the same directory where the downloaded files are, run
```
git pull
``` 
in the terminal and restart your browser / reload the extension.

OR

repeat the installation process again.

## How to use
1. Open your browser.
2. If values are not set, error will be displayed. In this case, set the values in "AutoJoomer" popup in "Extensions" panel.
3. In case you open your browser after a class has already started, the extension will automatically open that class as well given that it started in the last hour.
4. The extension will stop working when the browser is closed OR the day is over.
5. And thats it, you are good to go now.
